While describing the sequence of events that takes place at the neuromuscular junction, he mentions that as the action potential travels down the motor neuron, it causes depolarization of the presynaptic membrane. This results in the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, which leads to an influx of calcium into the synapse of the motor neuron. Consequently, the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions increases. Which of the following occurs at the neuromuscular junction as a result of this increase in cytosolic Ca2+?\n\t\t\tA.
